Note : You will have to create your own Admob account from developer admob console , Select Different types of ads like Banner, Interestitial, Native and Video Ads.Select particular ads from admob console and you will get different KEY for different ADS.

In Your case you won't need any google-services.json file.In My case i have synced Admob account and firebase account so i have created for that purpose.

use of google-services.json

google-services.json contains developer credentials and configuration settings, which is needed to verify while connecting with GoogleApiClient. Though your service is working fine with your test device as it is detecting your developer account but after releasing your app in public, it will not work without the json file. So don't delete it.
